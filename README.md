# 🛡️ TryHackMe Pre-Security Path Notes

This repository contains my notes, labs, and reflections from completing the **Pre-Security Learning Path** on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).  
The Pre-Security path is designed for beginners and covers the **fundamentals of cybersecurity**, networking, the web, and operating systems.  

I’m documenting everything here as part of my journey to become an **IoT & Cybersecurity Engineer**.  
Each module has its own notes in Markdown format, with key takeaways and practical examples.
