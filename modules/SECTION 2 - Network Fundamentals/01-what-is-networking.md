# 🌐 What is Networking?  

## 📌 Overview  
Networks are simply **things connected** — just like a friendship circle, transportation system, or electricity grid.  
In computing, networks connect devices so they can share information.  
---

## 🔗 Key Points  
- 🤝 A **network** = connected entities.  
- 💻 In computing: from **2 devices → billions** (phones, laptops, IoT, traffic lights, farms).  
- 📡 Purpose: enable devices to **communicate & exchange data**.  
- 🌍 Everyday examples: power grids ⚡, weather data 🌦️, postal systems 📬, road traffic 🚦.  
- 🛡️ Networking is **fundamental in cybersecurity**, since attacks & defenses rely on connected systems.  

**✨ Takeaway:** A network = **connections that allow communication** — the backbone of all computing.

# 🌍 What is the Internet?  

## 📌 Overview  
The Internet is the **largest network**, made up of many smaller networks joined together.

## 🔗 Key Points  
- 🌐 Internet = **a network of networks**.  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Example: Alice connects Bob & Jim with Zayn & Toby → like routers linking networks.

- 🕰️ History:  
  - 1960s → **ARPANET**, first computer network (US Defense project).  
  - 1989 → **Tim Berners-Lee created the WWW**, transforming the Internet into an information hub.  
- 🔒 Two types of networks:  
  - 🏠 **Private networks** → internal, restricted.  
  - 🌍 **Public networks** → the global Internet.  
- 🏷️ Devices use **addresses (labels)** to identify themselves in a network (covered later).  

**✨ Takeaway:** The Internet is simply a **giant network of smaller private & public networks**, enabling global communication.
