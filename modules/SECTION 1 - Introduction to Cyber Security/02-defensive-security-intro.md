📌 Room Overview

Defensive Security = protecting systems from attacks, detecting intrusions, and responding effectively.
Focuses on prevention, monitoring, and incident response. The “Blue Team” handles these tasks.

## 🟢 Task 1: 🏰 Introduction to Defensive Security  
- Goal: **🛑 prevent intrusions** and **🔎 detect/respond** when they happen.  
- Key practices: 👩‍💻 user training, 🖥️ patching, 📋 asset management, 🔥 firewalls, 🚫 IPS, 📊 logging, and 👀 monitoring.  
**✨ Takeaway:** Security isn’t just about stopping attacks, but also about **visibility** and **quick response**.

## 🟡 Task 2: 🧭 Areas of Defensive Security  
- 🏢 **SOC (Security Operations Center):** monitoring logs/events, spotting vulnerabilities, policy violations, intrusions.

- 🕵️ **Threat Intelligence:** gather & analyze data to understand adversaries and predict attacks.

- 🧑‍💻 **DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response):** investigate evidence, contain/respond to incidents.

- 🦠 **Malware Analysis:** study malicious programs (static/dynamic) to understand their behavior.

**✨ Takeaway:** Defensive security has multiple **specialized roles** that work together.

- Alerts: ❌ failed logins, 🌐 unknown IPs, ⚠️ suspicious connections.  
<img width="917" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37352190-7702-4107-a956-eb2beb45375f" />

- Analyst role = 🕵️‍♂️ investigate → ✅ confirm/deny → 🚨 respond.

**✨ Takeaway:** Defensive work = **triage, investigation, and response** — not every alert is an attack.

## 📝 Reflections  
This room highlighted the **breadth of defensive security**: from 🔒 prevention to 🕵️ investigation.  
The **SIEM simulation** showed how SOC analysts filter **noise vs real threats** to protect organizations effectively.
