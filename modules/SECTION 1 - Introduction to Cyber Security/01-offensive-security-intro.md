## 📌 Room Overview

This room introduces **Offensive Security**: the practice of simulating attacks against systems to improve their defenses.  
It includes three main tasks: understanding offensive security, hacking a first machine, and learning about careers in cyber.

---

## ✅ Task 1: What is Offensive Security?
- Offensive Security = simulating real-world attacks in a controlled environment.  
- Purpose: Identify vulnerabilities before malicious hackers exploit them.  
- Works hand-in-hand with **Defensive Security**, which focuses on protection. 

**Key takeaway:** To defend well, you must think like an attacker.

## ✅ Task 2: Hacking Your First Machine
- Used a **fake bank application** provided in the lab.  
- Tool: **Gobuster** to enumerate hidden directories/pages.

- Found admin login page → demonstrated basic reconnaissance techniques.  


**Key takeaway:** Enumeration is the first and most critical step in penetration testing.

## ✅ Task 3: Careers in Cyber Security
- Different paths in cyber:
  - **Red Team (Offensive Security)** → ethical hacking, pentesting, red teaming  
  - **Blue Team (Defensive Security)** → SOC analysts, threat hunters, defenders  
  - **Purple Team** → hybrid approach combining red + blue  
- Other specializations: forensics, IoT security, DevSecOps, cloud security.  

**Key takeaway:** Cybersecurity is broad; choose a path that matches your interests.

## 📝 Reflections
This room gave me my first hands-on feel for attacking a machine.  
I learned how important **enumeration** is, and I started to see how offensive and defensive security complement each other.  
I’m most interested in applying these skills to **IoT and Cloud Security**.
